This is an [Obsidian](obsidian.md) notebook. If you open this folder (rb1vn scenario) in obsidian as a vault, you'll see everything.

Why use this instead of google docs, you say? Because it has a "canvas" mode that really helps with planning things. It also has all the prerequisite addons installed already. 

I have decided to start writing the scenario of the RB1 VN. Will I finish it? Will I make it? Who knows.

Yes, this will be a normal vn... however, aside from RB1 vn, we will also be utilizing Kant's Critique of Pure Reason in order to teach new mahjongers how to actually play mahjong.
