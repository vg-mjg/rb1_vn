I think it’s important to put emphasis on the fact that some games you will just lose purely because of luck and you should not get mad over that, but even then there is still room to show your skill in mahjong. 

Although knowing the theory is a good first step it also needs to be accompanied with a lot of field experience, otherwise it’s pointless. 

Getting that out of the way let’s start.

In mahjong in order to win, you need your hand to have a yaku and also be in the correct shape. Starting with the correct shape discussion: it’s 4 triples/joints + 1 pair.  

At this point we differentiate the tiles into tiers in terms of efficiency. From worst to best.

HONOURS: More of the same tile

1 and 9: accepts 2 and 3 / 7 and 8 and themselves

2 and 8: accepts 1 and 3(ryanmen!) and 4 and themselves, shan’t mirror for the 8

3 4 5 6 7: same as 2/8 but can use one more tile to build ryanmen and one more tile for kanchan.

>Should probably have a minigame exercise here where they will have to pick between 2 tiles to see which is better. Make it timed so that they become anxious and also have some kind of effect, like a firework effect and sound effect for every correct answer. Nothing major like 10 comparisons max. If you fail at one you can review the lesson again or play again. Don’t use dragons for honours, prefer West and North because most of the time these are the more useless ones.

Continuing … Tiles together are strong! (with 3 tiles)

Here we will have WWYDs, not timed this time. Should NOT be iishanten.
