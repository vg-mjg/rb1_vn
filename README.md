# Riichi Book 1, the VN
(tentative title, subject to change)

## About
There was an idea. What if we had [Riichi Book 1](https://dainachiba.github.io/RiichiBooks/), take out the book part of it, and change it to a visual novel?

That’s it. That’s this project. RB1 with cute anime girls. If that doesn’t convince you, nothing else will.

## Roadmap
Under constructioni.
